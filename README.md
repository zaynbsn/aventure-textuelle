yarn install
```

### Usage

To start a new adventure, you only need to run this command :

```

Then you'll be able to play and progress in your story

Each step is automatically save, so if you quit the program, you can start again where you left off

If you want to reset your adventure run this command :

```bash
node reset
```

During the adventure you can see the stats about your character in './assets/character.json'

you'll see, depending on your choices, the file is updating in real time

### After

When you finish the first chapter, a markdown will summarize all your adventure.
